# Introduction #
The source code for the toolkit FTNCS-MAS is maintained in a Mercurial subversion like system for code management. This allows helps the core developers to keep track of code changes made during development. It also helps developers to analyse code changes and comment on them.
At least two repositories should be available:
  * One for Release versions of code commits, which should usually be made whenever a working version is achieved.
  * One for development and testing before releases.

Each developer can have his/her own development branch and they feel the need to have one's own development repository, then use the cloning facility made available at the [Checkout page](http://code.google.com/p/ftncs-mas/source/checkout), choose which repository to base the clone and then press the "Create clone" button.


# Reading material about Mercurial Source Control Management #

Here are the main pages you should read to learn more about Mercurial:
  * [The official page for Mercurial SCM](http://mercurial.selenic.com), which includes [Introduction to Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/UnderstandingMercurial) and [tutorial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Tutorial).
  * For a more **user friendly management of the code** in Windows OS, you can use [TortoiseHg for Windows Explorer](http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org) (Explorer, not Internet Explorer). It also has a good [quick tutorial](http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/manual/2.0/quick.html).
  * For more information, search online for "Mercurial".


# Why not use GIT/SVN or any other SCM system? #
Git is one of the most powerful software management systems around, but it isn't directly provided by Google Code; Mercurial is better than SVN for this project. Mercurial is simpler than SVN and Google Code provides a handy "Create Clone" system that can help projects to continue development, even if the official team is no longer able to work on the project!

Here are the answers for Frequently Asked Questions.


# What is the toolkit FTNCS-MAS? #
The toolkit Fault Tolerant Networked Control Systems based on Multi-Agent Systems, aka toolkit FTNCS-MAS, has been created to help FTNCS-MAS developers to easily create distributed agent based control platforms, without having to directly worry about the communication structure. This way developers only have to focus on the agents themselves and what data should be exchanged between agents, as well as what agent architecture should be used.

# What is the toolkit FTNCS-MAS license? #
The current license is [GNU's Lesser General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html). Basically, with this toolkit you can:
  * Use it freely in any work environment to create FTNCS-MAS applications developed in MATLAB with Simulink, xPC and Matlab's Distributed Computing toolboxes. Those designed applications can be used for personal, research and commercial environments. The resulting applications designed with the toolkit can be closed, namely the code can be closed and not accessible to the target user/client.
  * Can change the source code and improve/change how it works. For this we suggest that you use Google Code's cloning facility. Simply visit the [Checkout page](http://code.google.com/p/ftncs-mas/source/checkout) and press the "Create clone" button. Any improvements you do to this toolkit can then be added to this project.
  * If the changes to the toolkit are made for your personal/research/commercial projects and the developed applications are not sold to your users/clients, then you do not have to disclose your changes to anyone.

With this toolkit you **cannot**:
  * Hide the source of this toolkit or any of it's variations from your users/clients. In other words, the applications you create can be "closed source", but the toolkit used to generate them has to be provided at least to your clients if they so demand, for a value/access no greater than the application!
  * Make software **directly based** on this toolkit with a license other than [LGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html). In other words, if you develop and application/toolkit that integrates this toolkit for generating other FTNCS-MAS applications, then your application/toolkit is automatically under the GNU Lesser General Public License. This in fact means that you can sell your application/toolkit based on this toolkit's code, but you have to provide the code as well for a price no greater than your application/toolkit.

# Introduction #
The toolkit (or toolbox) Fault Tolerant Networked Control Systems based on Multi-Agent Systems (FTNCS-MAS) was designed to help in the design of several FTNCS-MAS architectures inside Matlab/Simulink®, with a little effort, giving you more time to spend on the micro-level architecture development of the agents and facilitators. You design the whole platform and architecture in Simulink®, under MATLAB®, and when you compile your project, the deployable architecture is created automatically and will be ready to be used in your test environment.

Several multi-agent platforms exist to deal with different problems but none of them to deal with control systems tolerant to faults using the Matlab/Simulink® environment, which is in our days the scientific tool to FDI/FTC research. Thus, the FTNCS-MAS toolbox has been developed in MATLAB®, using Simulink®, xPC Target and the Distributed Computing Toolbox. This last toolbox plus the MATLAB’s Distributed Computing Engine (MDCE) ensure the minimal services of a FIPA (The foundation for intelligent physical agents) compliance MAS platform.
